## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---

I recently graduated from Cal State Long Beach with my Masters in Computer Science, where I focused on projects related to embedded systems, bare-metal programming, and full-stack web development. I was a software engineering intern at [Epirus](https://www.epirusinc.com) working on Leonidas, a high powered directed energy system. Last year, I interned at HP Inc working in 3D printing and image processing. I'm currently in the market for work related to space exploration and defense. From Los Angeles, CA.
